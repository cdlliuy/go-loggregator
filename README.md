# go-loggregator [![slack.cloudfoundry.org][slack-badge]][loggregator-slack][![GoDoc][go-doc-badge]][go-doc]

This is a golang client library for [Loggregator][loggregator].

## Versions

At present, Loggregator supports two API versions: v1 (UDP) and v2 (gRPC).
This library provides clients for both versions.

Note that this library is also versioned. Its versions have *no* relation to
the Loggregator API. Presently, v2.0.0 is the most recent release.

## Usage

This repository should be imported as:

`import loggregator "code.cloudfoundry.org/go-loggregator"`

## Example

Example implementation of the client is provided in `examples/main.go`.

Build the example client by running `go build -o client main.go`

Collocate the `client` with a metron agent and set the following environment
variables: `CA_CERT_PATH`, `CERT_PATH`, `KEY_PATH`
